**Project description:**
BMCC Compass is a webapp that allows faculty to manage their classes and keep track of student assignments. Students with incomplete assignments can be easily be monitored by faculty, with assignments being added or deleted as needed. Students can view their assignments, mark them as complete, or request more information from their professor. The website featues a Watson Chatbot on the homepage to answer basic questions about classes, grading, and incomplete assignments.
